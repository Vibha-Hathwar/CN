PART - 1

1. Write a program for Error Detection using CRC-CCITT(16 bits).
2. For the given network graph, write a program to implement Link state routing algorithm to build a
routing table for the given node.
3. Write a program to divide the message into variable length frames and sort them and display the
message at the receiving side.
4. Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client – server program, the client sends the file name and the server
sends back the requested text file if present.
5. Using FIFOs as IPC channels, write a client – server program, the client sends the file name and the
server sends back the requested text file if present.
6. Using UDP, write a client – server program, to exchange messages between client and the server.
7. Write a socket program to demonstrate IP multicasting which provides the capability for an
application to send a single IP datagram that a group of hosts in a network can receive.
8. Write a program to implement sliding window protocol between two hosts.

PART B
  
1. Simulate a three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links between them.Set the queue size
and vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.
2. Simulate the different types of Internet traffic such as FTP and TELNET over a network and analyze the
throughput.
3. Simulate an Ethernet LAN using n nodes (6-10), change error rate and data rate and compare the
throughput.
4. Simulate an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and determine the collision
across different nodes.
5. Simulate the transmission of ping messages over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find
the number of packets dropped due to congestion.
6. A Simple ESS with transmitting nodes in Wireless LAN
7. A simple ad-hoc network with transmitting nodes
